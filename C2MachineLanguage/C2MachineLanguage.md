# Comparison Between C and Assembly Language

## An Example

Here letâ€™s look at an example in C that computes and prints out the Fibonacci Number up to 255 over and over again.

![image-20200331210522332](C2MachineLanguage.assets/image-20200331210522332.png)

Here we compile it using the GNU C compiler `gcc` and name the output file as `fib`:

```bash
gcc fib.c -o fib
```

The terminal output would look like this:

Let's then take a look at the disassembly of `fib`:

```bash
otool -tv fib
```

![image-20200331212921876](C2MachineLanguage.assets/image-20200331212921876.png)

Let's take a look at these lines in detail:

The first few lines are for the basic set up (stack frame) of the program, note here for ***registers***, we prefix them by `%` and for immediate values that are ***constants***, we prefix them by `$`:

```assembly
0000000100000f30	pushq	%rbp
0000000100000f31	movq	%rsp, %rbp
0000000100000f34	subq	$0x10, %rsp
0000000100000f38	movl	$0x0, -0x4(%rbp)
```

Starting from the following lines we are going into our code:

```assembly
0000000100000f3f	movl	$0x0, -0x8(%rbp)
```

Where `movl` stands for ***move long***, which in here moves value 0 (here represented in hexadecimal) into `-0x8(%rbp)` which is actually an address offset, note that here `%rbp` is the ***stack base pointer*** (start of stack), and `-0x8` is just the ***offset*** in hexadecimal format denoting a specific location in memory. Hence the above line of assemly code corresponds to the following line in C:

```c
x = 0;
```

Where `-0x8` memory denotes `x`.

Similarly the next line:

```assembly
0000000100000f46	movl	$0x1, -0xc(%rbp)
```

corresponds to:

```c
y = 1
```

where `-0xc` memory location denotes variable `y`.

Now we are entering the `while-loop` in the C program, the following 4 lines correspond to the `printf` function defined in the C standard library `stdio.h`:

```assembly
0000000100000f4d	movl	-0x8(%rbp), %esi
0000000100000f50	leaq	0x4f(%rip), %rdi
0000000100000f57	movb	$0x0, %al
0000000100000f59	callq	0x100000f86
```

Corresponds to:

```c
printf("%d\n", x);
```

where `%esi` is a *non-volatile general-purpose register* that is often used as a *pointer*, `%rip` is the ***instruction pointer***, which points to the next instruction to execute, and `%rdi` is the ***register destination index*** (destination for data copies), `movb` stands for ***move bytes***. The last line `callq` calls function `printf` defined in `stdio.h` from location `0x100000f86`.

The following lines are the main steps for the Fibonacci number generation:

```assembly
0000000100000f5e	movl	-0x8(%rbp), %ecx
0000000100000f61	addl	-0xc(%rbp), %ecx
0000000100000f64	movl	%ecx, -0x10(%rbp)
```

Corresponds to:

```c
z = x + y;
```

First we move (`movl`) `x` (`-0x8(%rbp)`) to `%ecx`, which is a *volatile general-purpose register* that is occasionally used as a ***function parameter*** or as a ***loop counter***. Then we add (`addl`, add long) `y` (`-0xc(%rbp)`) to register `%ecx`  and store (`movl`) the result to a new register `-0x10(%rbp)`, which is `z` here.

Similarly, the following two lines:

```assembly
0000000100000f67	movl	-0xc(%rbp), %ecx
0000000100000f6a	movl	%ecx, -0x8(%rbp)
```

Corresponds to:

```c
x = y;
y = z;
```

Then we approach the `while-loop` part:

```assembly
0000000100000f73	cmpl	$0xff, -0x8(%rbp)
0000000100000f7a	jl	0x100000f4d
0000000100000f80	jmp	0x100000f3f
```

`compl` stands for ***compare long***, where we compare `x` (`-0x8(%rbp)`) with 255 (`$0xff`) and `jl` (jump if less than) to location `0x100000f4d` which is the following:

```assembly
0000000100000f4d	movl	-0x8(%rbp), %esi
```

along with the following two lines, corresponding to:

```c
printf("%d\n", x);
```

Then finally, `jmp` (jump) to `0x100000f3f`, which corresponds to:

```assembly
0000000100000f3f	movl	$0x0, -0x8(%rbp)
```

Which is:

```c
x = 0;
```
